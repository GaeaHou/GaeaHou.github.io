## PROJECTS

### Southern University of Science and Technology  — Shenzhen, China

**Developer, Advisor: Prof. Kemi Ding**  — 03/2024 - 06/2024  
- **Project:** A Multi-Modal Method for Domain Adaptation In Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation  
  The goal of this project is to apply transfer learning methods to help neural networks perform semantic segmentation of point clouds. It involves three fields: multi-modal learning, point cloud semantic segmentation, and domain adaptation.  
  - An adversarial training method is used to better utilize all the information of the 2D image, involving a discriminator to determine the domain of the feature map.
  - The CoSMix model consists of three primary components: Semantic Selection, Compositional Mix, and Training and Update, aimed at facilitating robust and adaptive point cloud segmentation.

**Developer, Advisor: Prof. Wei Zhang**  — 04/2024 - 06/2024  
- **Project:** State Estimation for A Biped Robot  
  - The Kalman filter is used for state estimation, providing more precise estimates than single measurements.  
  - Implementing a state estimator for a bipedal robot to provide observation input for its control strategy.

**Developer, Advisor: Prof. Wei Zhang**  — 04/2024 - 06/2024  
- **Project:** RL Training of Inverted Singular and Double Pendulums  
  - Achieved balance control of the inverted pendulum under small disturbances using reinforcement learning.
  - DDPG algorithm is applied to output optimal continuous actions.

**Developer, Advisor: Prof. Xiaojing Wang**  — 03/2024 - 06/2024  
- **Project:** Using STC89C52RC Microcontroller to Make A Simple Electronic Keyboard  
  - Designed an electronic keyboard using the STC89C52RC microcontroller, allowing a single button to output notes with a total of 8 buttons.

**Developer, Advisor: Prof. Xiaojing Wang**  — 09/2023 - 01/2024  
- **Project:** Realizing Screen Expansion of OpenMV Development Board  
  - Adapted domestic components based on open-source schematics and optimized the code for the new OpenMV firmware version.
